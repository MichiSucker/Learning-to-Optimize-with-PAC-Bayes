# Learning-to-Optimize with PAC-Bayesian Guarantees
### by Michael Sucker, Jalal Fadili and Peter Ochs
This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments of our paper ["Learning-to-Optimize with PAC-Bayesian Guarantees:
Theoretical Considerations and Practical Implementation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03290).

## TODO: 
  - Explain architecture
  - Explain how to reproduce experiments
  - Include figures
